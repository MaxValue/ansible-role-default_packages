# Ansible Role: Default Packages

An Ansible Role that installs a set of predefined packages on the host.

[TOC]

## Requirements

_None._

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

### Main Variables

    packages:
      - zsh
      - mosh
      - rsync
      - vim

The optional variable `packages` defines the list of packages to be installed.
Each item can also be a mapping; in this case, there should be a key `all` which is the fallback name
for all package managers. Using the package manager name as key
you can define an alternative package name for that specific package manager.
Using `''` as a value for a package manager skips this package for that package manager.

### Internal variables

These are variables internally created by the role. Please do not use them in your code.

    _packages_selected_raw

The internal variable `_packages_selected_raw` contains a string of comma separated package names taken from the `packages` variable.

    _packages_selected

The internal variable `_packages_selected` contains a list of package names taken from the `_packages_selected_raw` variable.

## Dependencies
